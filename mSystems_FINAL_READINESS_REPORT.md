## ⚠️ WORD COUNT CHECK

**Estimated body text word count:** ~5,631 words (including table content)

**mSystems limit for Methods and Protocols:** 5,000 words (excluding references, tables, and figure legends)

**Status:** May be slightly over limit if table content is included in count. However:
- Tables are typically excluded from word count
- Figure legends are excluded
- The actual text-only word count is likely under 5,000

**Recommendation:** Verify exact word count excluding tables during final review. If over, consider:
- Moving some validation details to supplemental material
- Condensing discussion sections slightly
- Shortening some methodological descriptions

# Word Count - Definitive Answer

## ✅ DEFINITIVE WORD COUNT

**Body text word count (excluding references, tables, figure legends, equations):** **5,054 words**

**mSystems limit for Methods and Protocols:** **5,000 words**

**Status:** **54 words OVER the limit** (1.08% over)

## Analysis

The manuscript is **54 words over** the 5,000 word limit. This is a very small amount (just 1% over), which can easily be addressed with minor edits.

### What Was Excluded from Count:
- ✅ References section (all 43 references)
- ✅ Tables (all 5 tables - Table 1-5)
- ✅ Table captions/headers
- ✅ Mathematical equations (both inline $ and block $$)
- ✅ Abstract and Importance sections (have their own limits)
- ✅ Title page elements
- ✅ Markdown formatting

### What Was Included:
- ✅ All body text from INTRODUCTION through CONCLUSION
- ✅ All subsection text
- ✅ All paragraph text
- ✅ All list items (numbered and bulleted)

## Recommendation

**Option 1: Minor Condensing (Recommended)**
Remove ~54 words through minor edits:
- Condense 1-2 sentences in Discussion
- Shorten a few methodological descriptions
- Combine some redundant phrases

**Option 2: Move Content to Supplemental**
Move some validation details to supplemental material (if allowed by journal)

**Option 3: Request Exception**
Given it's only 1% over, you could submit as-is and note the slight overage in cover letter (though this is not recommended)

## Quick Fixes to Get Under Limit

Here are some easy places to trim ~54 words:

1. **Discussion section** - Condense 1-2 sentences (saves ~20-30 words)
2. **Methods section** - Shorten some descriptions (saves ~15-20 words)
3. **Results section** - Remove redundant phrases (saves ~10-15 words)

**Total potential savings: 45-65 words** (easily gets you under 5,000)

## Conclusion

**Answer: NO, currently 54 words over (5,054 vs 5,000 limit)**

However, this is easily fixable with minor edits. The manuscript is **99% compliant** and just needs small adjustments to be perfectly within the limit.

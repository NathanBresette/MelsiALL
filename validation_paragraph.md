## **What We Tested MeLSI On**

**MeLSI was rigorously validated across diverse microbiome datasets to ensure robust performance and generalizability. We tested the method on synthetic data with controlled signal strengths (weak, medium, strong) and null data for Type I error validation, encompassing 60-200 samples with 150-200 taxa. Real-world validation included the Atlas1006 human gut microbiome dataset (1,114 individuals, 123 taxa) comparing male vs female microbiomes, and the DietSwap dietary intervention dataset (74 stool samples, 118 taxa) contrasting Western (HE) versus high-fiber (DI) diets. Additionally, we conducted comprehensive statistical validation including power analysis across effect sizes, multiple testing correction for multi-group comparisons, and computational efficiency testing. MeLSI was compared against traditional distance metrics including Bray-Curtis, Euclidean, Jaccard, and phylogenetic UniFrac distances using PERMANOVA with permutation testing. This multi-faceted validation approach ensures MeLSI's reliability across different microbiome types, sample sizes, and research questions.**

## **Alternative Shorter Version**

**MeLSI was validated on synthetic data with controlled signal strengths and null data for statistical validation, real microbiome datasets including the Atlas1006 human gut dataset (1,114 individuals, 123 taxa) and DietSwap dietary intervention dataset (74 samples, 118 taxa), and comprehensive statistical testing including power analysis and computational efficiency. The method was compared against traditional distance metrics (Bray-Curtis, Euclidean, Jaccard, UniFrac) using PERMANOVA with permutation testing, ensuring robust performance across diverse microbiome research applications.**
